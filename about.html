  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This website is designed to be a tracking page for my project to take a photo of someone from every country in the world.</p>
  <p>I've tried a few different ways of tracking the project, and although this will involve more work, it's the best way to visualise it.</p>
  <p>If you'd like to follow the progress please feel free! I'll update this for my own benefit as I go along.</p>
  <p>I ask if you do follow along, please don't share any of the photos as they are obviously photos of people and I don't want their photos to be distributed without their consent.</p>
  <p> Thanks for checking in on the project!</p>
