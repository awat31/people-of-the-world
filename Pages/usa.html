  <h2 class="hidden">Info</h2>
  <p class="hidden">Ralph was a family friend who lived with my Grandfather on Ascension Island during the 1980s, alongwith my (very young) Dad, Aunty and my Grandmother. He was on deployement from with the US Government while my Granfather was on deployment with the UK. He was very much an extended family member. Upon his return to the states he married Debbie, and they lived happily in various cities and states across the US, including Florida and Ohio. This photo was taken during their last visit to the UK in 2019.</p>
  <p class="hidden">Ralph passed away in 2020</p>
  <p class="hidden">Debbie passed away shortly after, in 2021</p>
